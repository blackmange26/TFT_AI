This repo is still in-progress, but has been put on hold for now pending other projects

5/25: Committed many updates, including:
	(1) revert shop to allow for all champions, not just 5 on bench (this is for testing)
	(2) fix shop so that purchasing champions deducts from gold
	(3) allow combat to take in two agent-types so it can update hp
	(4) creation of TFTGameEnv
	(5) ability to get champion by index (this is needed since action space is by number)
